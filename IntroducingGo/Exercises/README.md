# Exercises

- Chapter 1:
    1. Write the program to print `Hello, my name is` followed by your name.
- Chapter 2:
    1. Write a program that computes 32,132 x 42,452 and prints it to the terminal (use the * operator for multiplication).
- Chapter 3:
    1. Write a program that converts from Fahrenheit into Celsius (C=(F - 32) * 5/9).
    2. Write a program that converts from feet into meters (1 ft = 0.3048 m).
- Chapter 4:
    1. Write a program that prints out all the numbers between 1 and 100 that are evenly divisible by 3 (i.e. 3, 6, 9, etc).
    2. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of tree, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both tree and five, print "FizzBuzz"
- Chapter 5:
    1. Write a program that finds the smallest number in this list:
        ```go
        x := []int{
            48,96,86,68,
            57,82,63,70,
            37,34,83,27,
            19,97,9,17,
        }
- Chapter 6:
    1. Write a program that can swap two integers (x := 1; y :=  2; swap(&x, &y) should give you x=2 and y=1)
- Chapter 7:
    1. Add a new perimiter method to the Shape interface to calculate the perimiter of a shape. Implement the method for `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
- Chapter 8:
    1. We copied the `average` function from Chapter 6 to our new package. Create `Min` and `Max` functions that find the minimum and maximum values in a slice of `float64`s.
- Chapter 9:
    1. Write a series of tests for the `Min` and `Max` functions you wrote in the previous chapter.
- Chapter 10:
    1. Write your own `Sleep` function using `time.After`.
